This project focuses on enhancing theoretical understanding and practical implementation of reliable data transfer protocols. The goal is to implement the RDTv2.2 protocol, a stop-and-wait protocol using positive acknowledgment with retransmission. The key characteristics include an alternating bit protocol, 1-bit packet sequence numbers, tolerance for packet corruption, but not for packet loss or out-of-order delivery.
